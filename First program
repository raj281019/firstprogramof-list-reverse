This is my first code on how i finally reversed a list and stored in a new variable
Code -

#Random list 'a' is created 
a = [1,23,312,12,312,12,123,231212]

print(f'the simplest way to reverse a string is printing using indexing like: {a[::-1]}\nbut i have written the code for creating a new variable and storing the list in that new variable')
b = [] #created another list to store reversed list
i = 1 #assigning for looping process
for num in a:
    for elements in range(0,len(a)):
        b.append(a[-i])                             #appending the value in the list on particular indixes
        i += 1                                      #increment for the variable to get to the next value
        print(f"list have become changed as {b}")   #printing the newly created list 
        break                                       #breaking the loops
